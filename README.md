Hello World!

1) Create a Github account.

2) Download Github desktop: Just watch this video if you are confused. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFix7UDJ7LA

3) Set up a local repository in Github desktop (Just whereever you are keeping your files). Then config username, password etc etc. so it logs you into your Github account

4) Feel free to set up your own files in your local repository: index.html for example, and submit it to github with "push"

**please submit your files committed to README only for now not master** Select Readme under branch, Not Master, under tabs in Github

= Git words made simple =

- Repository: Just a word for shared project
- Pull request: Your request to download the repository
- Clone: Copying the repository
- Push: submitting your file to the url
